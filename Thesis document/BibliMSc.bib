Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Here we report on the current knowledge of present-day sea level change. We briefly present observational results on sea level change from satellite altimetry since 1993 and tide gauges for the past century. We next discuss recent progress made in quantifying the processes causing sea level change on time scales ranging from years to decades, i.e., thermal expansion, land ice mass loss and land water storage change. For the 1993-2003 decade, the sum of climate-related contributions agree well (within the error bars) with the altimetry-based sea level, half of the observed rate of rise being due to ocean thermal expansion, land ice plus land waters explaining the other half. Since about 2003, thermal expansion increase has stopped, whereas the sea level continues to rise, although at a reduced rate compared to the previous decade (2.5 mm/yr versus 3.1 mm/yr). Recent increases in glacier melting and ice mass loss from the ice sheets appear able to account alone for the rise in sea level reported over the last five years. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

Yearly and year-season upper ocean temperature anomaly fields, 1948-1998, pp. 23, U.S. Gov. Printing Office, Washington, DC] and Ishii et al., 2003 [Ishii, M., Kimoto, M., Kachi, M., 2003. Historical ocean subsurface temperature analysis with error estimates, Monthly Weather Rev., 131, 51-73]). These data sets which provide gridded temperatures, down to 3000 m and 500 m respectively, are based on interpolation schemes of raw historical profiles over 1950-1998. We find that the two data sets compare well over 1950-1990, both in terms of thermosteric sea-level trends and global mean. Some difference is noticed however beyond 1990, due to differences in the raw temperature data processing. Analyses based on 'Empirical Orthogonal Function' show that the interannual variability of the thermosteric sea level is dominated by the signatures of El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and influenced by North Atlantic Oscillation. As a result, regional thermosteric sea-level trends are not stationary on a century time scale and have a typical lifetime on the order of a decade. In terms of global mean, the rate of thermosteric sea-level change computed over 10-year windows displays high variability, with values reaching up to three times the 40-year (1950-1990) average at some periods. Even negative values are noticed at other periods. One important consequence is that the pattern of sea-level trends derived from Topex/Poseidon altimetry over 1993-2003, which is mainly caused by thermal expansion, is very likely a non-permanent feature. Thus past and future extrapolation based on this 10-year altimetry pattern should be considered with caution. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This is because the amplitudes of all the equatorial waves are proportional to sea level at this longitude, and the amplitudes at other longitudes can he deduced by integrating along characteristics using the method of Gill and Clarke (1974). The integration proceeds forward in time for the planetary waves and backward in time for the Kelvin wave. The calculation requires a knowledge of wind stress anomalies, although the wind effect only becomes significant after integration to large distances from the eastern boundary.

The technique is applied to estimate zonal surface current anomalies in the equatorial Pacific for the period 1971-73 spanning a major El Ni{\~{n}}o.

The striking result here is that surface temperature anomalies in the central Pacific are well reproduced in both amplitude and timing it caused solely by horizontal advection by the zonal current anomaly.

	abstract = {To predict future coastal hazards, it is important to quantify any links between climate drivers and spatial patterns of coastal change. However, most studies of future coastal vulnerability do not account for the dynamic components of coastal water levels during storms, notably wave-driven processes, storm surges and seasonal water level anomalies, although these components can add metres to water levels during extreme events. Here we synthesize multi-decadal, co-located data assimilated between 1979 and 2012 that describe wave climate, local water levels and coastal change for 48 beaches throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. We find that observed coastal erosion across the Pacific varies most closely with El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation, with a smaller influence from the Southern Annular Mode and the Pacific North American pattern. In the northern and southern Pacific Ocean, regional wave and water level anomalies are significantly correlated to a suite of climate indices, particularly during boreal winter; conditions in the northeast Pacific Ocean are often opposite to those in the western and southern Pacific. We conclude that, if projections for an increasing frequency of extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events over the twenty-first century are confirmed, then populated regions on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean basin could be alternately exposed to extreme coastal erosion and flooding, independent of sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Interannual global mean sea level (GMSL) variations and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are highly correlated, with positive/negative GMSL anomalies during El Nino/La Nina events. In a previous study, we showed that interannual GMSL and total land water storage variations are inversely correlated, with lower-than-average total water storage on land and higher-than-average GMSL during El Nino. This result is in agreement with the observed rainfall deficit/excess over land/oceans during El Nino (and vice versa during La Nina). It suggests that the positive GMSL anomaly observed during El Nino is likely due to an ocean mass rather than thermal expansion increase. Here, we analyze the respective contribution of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans to the interannual (ENSO-related) GMSL anomalies observed during the altimetry era (i.e., since 1993) with an emphasis on the 1997/1998 El Nino event. For each oceanic region, we compute the steric contribution, and remove it from the altimetry-based mean sea level to estimate the ocean mass component. We find that mass changes of the tropical Pacific Ocean, mainly in the region within 0-25°N, are mostly responsible for the observed 1997/1998 ENSO-related GMSL anomaly. The ocean mass excess of this region almost perfectly compensates the total land water deficit during the 1997/1998 El Nino. An estimate of the ocean-atmosphere water balance of this region shows that the time derivative of the ocean mass component is well correlated with net P-E (precipitation minus evaporation) over most of the study period, except during the 1997/1998 ENSO event, where there is a temporary ocean mass increase, not compensated by the net P-E. We thus propose that the 1997/1998 ocean mass increase of this north tropical Pacific area be linked to an imbalance between the inflow/outflow entering/leaving the north tropical Pacific. A preliminary qualitative analysis indicates that a significant reduction of the Makassar Strait transport, (about 80{\%} of the total Indonesian throughflow), as previously reported in the literature during the strong 1997/1998 El Nino event, could explain the north tropical Pacific Ocean mass excess reported in this study, hence the observed positive GMSL anomaly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Regional sea level rise (SLR) acceleration during the past few decades north of Cape Hatteras has commonly been attributed to weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, although this causal link remains debated. In contrast to this pattern, we demonstrate that SLR decelerated north of Cape Hatteras and accelerated south of the Cape to {\textgreater}20 mm/yr, {\textgreater} 3 times the global mean values from 2011 to 2015. Tide gauge records reveal comparable short-lived, rapid SLR accelerations (hot spots) that have occurred repeatedly over {\~{}}1500 km stretches of the coastline during the past 95 years, with variable latitudinal position. Our analysis indicates that the cumulative (time-integrated) effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation determine the latitudinal position of these SLR hot spots, while a cumulative El Ni{\~{n}}o index is associated with their timing. The superposition of these two ocean-atmospheric processes accounts for 87{\%} of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations.},

@article{Zhang2012,
	abstract = {Linear trend analysis is commonly applied to quantify sea level change, often over short periods because of limited data availability. However, the linear trend computed over short periods is complicated by large-scale climate variability which can affect regional sea level on interannual to inter-decadal time scales. As a result, the meaning of a local linear sea level trend over the short altimeter era (since 1993; less than 20 years) is unclear, and it is not straightforward to distinguish the regional sea level changes associated with climate change from those associated with natural climate variability. In this study, we use continuous near-global altimeter measurements since 1993 to attempt to separate interannual and decadal sea level variability in the Pacific from the sea level trend. We conclude that the rapid rates of sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific found from a single variable linear regression analysis are partially due to basin-scale decadal climate variability. The negligible sea level rise, or even falling sea level, in the eastern tropical Pacific and US west coast is a result of the combination of decreasing of sea level associated with decadal climate variability and a positive sea level trend. The single variable linear regression analysis only accounts for slightly more than 20{\%} of the observed variance, whereas a multiple variable linear regression including filtered indices of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation accounts for almost 60{\%} of the observed variance. {\textcopyright} 2012.

The powerful tools of mathematical statistics therefore find wide application in climatological research, ranging from simple methods for determining the uncertainty of a climatological mean to sophisticated techniques which reveal the dynamics of the climate system. The purpose of this book is to help the climatologist understand the basic precepts of the statisticians art and to provide some of the background needed to apply statistical methodology correctly and usefully. The book is self contained: introductory material, standard advanced techniques, and the specialized techniques used specifically by climatologists are all contained within this one source. There is a wealth of real- world examples drawn from the climate literature to demonstrate the need, power and pitfalls of statistical analysis in climate research. This book is suitable as a main text for graduate courses on statistics for climatic, atmospheric and oceanic science. It will also be valuable as a reference source for researchers in climatology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and oceanography.},

@article{Soumya2015,
	abstract = {The South China Sea (SCS) is the largest marginal sea in the western Pacific Basin. Sea level anomalies (SLAs) in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are assumed to be governed by various phenomena associated with the adjacent parts of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. We have used monthly sea level anomalies obtained from 12 tide gauge stations of PSMSL and UHSLC and merged and gridded AVISO products of SLAs (sea level anomalies) derived from satellite altimeter. We find that IOD-influenced inter-annual variations are found only in the southwestern and southeastern coastal regions of SSCS. Our analysis reveals that inter-annual regional sea level drops are associated with positive phase of the IOD, and the rises with negative phase of the IOD. SLA variations at decadal scale in the southeastern and northern Gulf of Thailand correlate with Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO). Multiple linear regression analysis of inter-annual SLAs and climate indices shows that IOD induced inter-annual variations dominate in the southwestern SCS and it contributes to about {\~{}}. 40{\%} of inter-annual sea level variation. Meanwhile, ENSO contributes to around {\~{}}. 30{\%} variation in sea level in the southwestern and {\~{}}. 40{\%} variation in the southeastern SSCS. The present study also suggests that inter-annual SLA variations in the SSCS can occur by ENSO and IOD induced changes in wind stress curl and volume transport variations.},

Also included in the survey is a theorem showing that any L2 function can be implemented to any desired degree of accuracy with a three-layer backpropagation neural network. An appendix presents a speculative neurophysiological model illustrating the way in which the backpropagation neural network architecture might plausibly be implemented in the mammalian brain for corticocortical learning between nearby regions of cerebral cortex. One of the crucial decisions in the design of the backpropagation architecture is the selection of a sigmoidal activation function.},
